# flask-mega-tutorial

This project was just me working my way haphazardly thorugh Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial.
I was primarily interested in the Docker and deployment chapters. None of this is my own work, I just 
worked through his book to learn another's perspective on Flask. Ultimately I've decided I will probably 
never use Jinja and Python to run the front-end, as many of his 'solutions' with Jinja are just 
ways to reinvent things that are much more easily solved with React.
